# üìå Two Pointers Pattern 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Two Pointers Pattern?
The **Two Pointers** technique means using **two variables (pointers or indices)** to scan through data (like arrays or strings) **in a coordinated way** instead of using nested loops.

The main goal: **Solve problems faster ‚Äî usually O(n) instead of O(n¬≤).**

üí° **Think of it as**: two people reading the same story but starting at different pages and moving depending on the clues in the story.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ When to Recognize That Two Pointers Will Work

Look for problems where:
- The input is **sorted** (array or linked list).
- You need to **find pairs/triplets/subarrays** with a certain property (sum, product, difference, etc.).
- You need to **reverse or rearrange data** in place.
- You are working with **two sequences** and comparing them.
- You need to **detect cycles** (slow & fast pointer technique in linked lists).
- You want to **skip duplicates or filter elements** without extra space.

üí° **Key Recognition Tip:**  
If you find yourself writing a **nested loop (O(n¬≤))** but the data is sorted OR you can sort it, there‚Äôs a good chance Two Pointers can replace that with **O(n)**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Common Types of Two Pointers

| Type | Direction | When to Use | Example Problem |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Opposite Direction** | Start one at beginning, one at end | Find a pair with a given sum, reverse an array | Find two numbers that sum to a target |
| **Same Direction** | Both start from same point | Compare/subsequence matching | Merge two sorted arrays |
| **Slow & Fast** | One moves faster | Detect cycles, find middle of list | Linked list cycle detection |
| **Sliding Window (variation)** | Adjust start & end | Subarray problems with constraints | Longest substring without repeating chars |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Core Tricks for Applying Two Pointers

1. **Move the correct pointer**  
   - If sum too small ‚Üí move `left++`  
   - If sum too big ‚Üí move `right--`

2. **Avoid unnecessary comparisons**  
   - If already processed an element, skip duplicates.

3. **Use sorting if needed**  
   - Many problems need sorting first to make Two Pointers possible.

4. **Work in-place when possible**  
   - Reduces space usage from O(n) ‚Üí O(1).

5. **Think about stopping condition**  
   - Usually `left < right` for opposite direction.

###  Opposite Direction Visual (Two Pointers)

Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you visualize two pointers moving inward:

- **Left Pointer** starts at the beginning.
- **Right Pointer** starts at the end.
- They move inward based on the comparison with the target value.
